# Elevator
Project to simulate an elevator control, which controls two elevators optimizing time and energy


This project was developped by Pedro Fornari and Bruno Neckel.

It's a C++ project which simulates the control of two elevators.
the project tries to optimize time and energy, but still having some problems.
The software used in develop time was the CodeBlock, which managed our folders and files.
You will have to add the libraries stdint.h or inttypes.h to execute the code.

For more details the reader can see the report file, only in portuguese by now.
